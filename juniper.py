# The given Python code defines a function find_subnet() that takes a list of IPv4 addresses in string format as input and returns the minimal spanning subnet in CIDR notation.

# The code uses the socket and struct modules to convert IPv4 addresses to binary format and vice versa.

# The ipv4_to_binary() function uses struct.unpack() method to convert the IPv4 address into a 32-bit binary representation, which is returned as an integer. The binary_to_ipv4() function uses the socket.inet_ntoa() method to convert the 32-bit binary representation back into an IPv4 address in string format.

# The find_subnet() function first converts all the IPv4 addresses in the input list to binary format using the ipv4_to_binary() function and stores them in a new list list_ip_binary.

# Then, it sorts the list of binary addresses in ascending order using the sort() method.

# Next, it iterates through the sorted binary addresses from the first binary address to the last binary address and finds the longest common prefix (LCP) between the adjacent binary addresses. The LCP is the number of leftmost bits that are common to all the binary addresses in the list.

# Finally, the function returns the minimal spanning subnet in CIDR notation by shifting the leftmost 32 - LCP bits of the first binary address to the right, converting the resulting binary prefix back into an IPv4 address using the binary_to_ipv4() function and appending the number of bits in the subnet mask as a suffix.

# The code then creates a list of IP addresses, calls the find_subnet() function with the list as input, and prints the resulting minimal spanning subnet in CIDR notation.

# In this case, the output of the program is 125.0.0.0/7, which means that the minimal spanning subnet for the given list of IP addresses is 125.0.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.128.0.0, i.e., the first 7 bits of the IP address represent the network portion of the address, and the remaining 25 bits represent the host portion of the address.
